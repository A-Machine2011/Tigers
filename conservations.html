    <h1>Conservation Efforts</h1>
        <span>Many things have been done to <strong>protect tigers</strong> in <strong>India</strong> and from <strong>all around the world</strong>.</span>
    <br><br>
    
    <h2>Reasons Why Tigers are Endangered</h2>
        <ol class="section">
            <li>Habitat Loss</li>
            <li>Hunting</li>
            <li>Shortage of Prey</li>
        </ol>
<br><br>
        <div class="conservation extra">
            <h2>Scientific Research</h2>
    <br>
            <p>We can't help and protect tigers without researching their behaviors, habitats, and problems etc.  
<br><br>
               WCS scientists are collborating with wildlife statisticians and local goverment to protect tigers.</p>

        <div class="conservation needed">
            <h2>Human and Tiger Conflicts</h2>
<br>
            <p>Humans and tigers don't get along well.  Humans hunt and poach tigers while tigers can sometimes attack humans.  Tigers are 
                dangerous and can attack livestock and humans of any form.  
                <br><br>
               But maybe the real problem is that we don't really understand them.  
               <a href="https://www.carerescuetexas.com/meet-the-animals/tigers/">The Care Rescue Texas</a> states that
               "Despite reputation, most tigers avoid humans; however, a few do become dangerous man-eaters. These animals are often sick 
               and unable to hunt normally, or live in areas where their traditional prey has vanished."</p>
